### üì¶ Dynamic Inventory Checking
The Shopify product inventory is being checked in realtime, therefore no rebuilding and redeploy is needed when a product goes out of stock. This avoids problems where products could still be available even though they're out of stock due to redeploy delay.

### üñå Styling
I'm using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) as styled components library, but the starter is purposely only sparsely styled so you don't have to remove unecessary code but can instead add your own styling immediately.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common problems

- You need to use the Shopify Storefront API credentials not the regular Shopify API.
- You need to have at least one published product on Shopify.
